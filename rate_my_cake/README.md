# Rate My Cake (Coding Dojo MEAN Assignment)

For this assignment I created an application that allows users to submit pictures of cakes. All the cakes may be viewed, rated from 1-5 stars, and commented upon. When a cake image is clicked, have a nested details component show the image, the baker of the cake, the average rating, and all the different ratings and comments.

All of the nested components refresh data/manipulate DOM without needing full web page refresh.
