# Ninja Gold (Coding Dojo MEAN Assignment)

For this assignment, I created a mini-game that helps a ninja make some money! When you start the game, the ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different amounts of gold. In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or LOSE up to 50 golds. This web application allows the ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.
